                <h2>SaaS - Developing The Future </h2><br>
                <p>Did you know that there is software for dog walking and pet sitting? Or did you know that there is software to prevent hair loss? Yes, you heard that right. It is as cool as weird as it sounds. If you canâ€™t believe me, Google it yourself
                    and you will be surprised.</p><br><br>

                <p>With that revelation, let me ask you this; can you imagine a world without software? That would be a terrible scenario, which thankfully will never manifest. However, it would be a nightmare to live in a world that knows no software.<br><br>                    Today, the modern world is inseparable from software technology. From milking cows to launching rockets, every industry needs software of one form or the other to keep it fully and wholly functioning. <br><br>With that said, it is
                    rational to consider the increasing demand for new software to run the show in every industry on its own terms. That is where SaaS steps in as the redeeming strategy to gain time-neutralized, accessible, mobile, and future-ready business
                    solutions.
                    <br><br> Do any of these factors sound outlandish to you? But it is actually made possible and is getting better and better.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3> Reasons why Saas is the future</h3><br>
                <details>
                    <summary>Artificial Inteligence</summary><br>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most innovative technologies to adapt SaaS-driven approaches to an unimaginable extent. It brings hyper-personalization, high-quality support services, less coding, security breach identification,
                        and dynamic pricing. Eg. Upselling products on Amazon.

                    <summary>Micro SAAS</summary><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>The competition in the SaaS landscape is getting fiercer and more abundant. One way of adapting to this competitive environment is to create smaller, more flexible products, run by small teams, even a single person. This is where Micro
                        SaaS comes in. These products are the extensions of larger products and are lower risk, and inexpensive to run. Time tracking apps and meal planning apps are great examples of Micro SaaS products. Eg. Paprika and Plan to eat apps.

                    <summary>Intergations</summary><br>
                    <p>Unlike the early days of SaaS where integration was an alien concept, today SaaS comes with vast integration capabilities. It is the ideal solution for businesses that prefer a hybrid system that combines a cloud back-end and on-premise
                        system. This model offers seamless automation and merging with multiple platforms. Eg. Google Maps integrated with a SaaS software that requires distance tracking or calculation.
